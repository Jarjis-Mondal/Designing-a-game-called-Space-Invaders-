# Developing-a-game-called-Space-Invaders-
The objective of this project is to design a simple game using MATLAB. The game is called "Space Invaders".  
At the beginning of the game, monsters start to appear in the screen. And there is a spaceship that can shoot the monsters. The game ends once the monsters reach the bottom end of the screen. 
We have used some variables and user defined functions to run the code perfectly.
